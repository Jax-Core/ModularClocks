## About

![ModularClocks](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/i/97bfd084-7ef0-496f-a835-3c41f482d38c/dem902r-659bc44d-7939-4cc8-9eb4-e638bf22c97d.png)

ModularClocks is a Rainmeter skin that includes a gallery of hand-crafted rainmeter clocks, a preview option, and an efficient settings menu.


## Features

* 5 Clock Presets
* Animated Styles
* Resizable Styles 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rainmeter v4.5 or newer.** Rainmeter can be installed by downloading the `.exe` file [from Rainmeter's official website.](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
- **JaxCore v40005 or newer.** JaxCore can be installed by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Installation

Assuming you successfully downloaded and installed Rainmeter as well as JaxCore, you can now proceed to install ModularClocks by following the steps below.

1. Download and run the `.rmskin` file for **ModularClocks** from the official [JaxCore site](https://jax-core.github.io/) to install **ModularClocks**.
2. Leave the installation settings at their defaults and click Install.
3. When the installation is finished, a startup pop-up should appear. Follow through the pop-up to finish installing **ModularClocks**.

* Note:  If you find that the JaxCore option is red on the startup pop-up, please press the red button and Core will be installed automatically. Perchance this fails, you can manually install Core by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Setting Up

To use video the custom clock styles, you must first install and configure **[ImageMagick](https://github.com/khanhas/MagickMeter).** Follow the instructions below to setup **ImageMagick**.


#### Installing ImageMagick:

1. Open **[this link](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows)**. This link will take you to another site where you must locate and download the appropriate installer.
2. Find a suitable release under **Windows Binary Release** that corresponds to your requirements and download it. The `ImageMagick-7.1.0-19-Q16-HDRI-x64-dll.exe` executable will be used to install for this guide.
3. After the download is complete, run the installer, which in this case is `ImageMagick-7.1.0-19-Q16-HDRI-x64-dll.exe`.
4. Leave the installation settings at their defaults and follow through the installation. You can tinker around with the settings **ONLY** if you know what they do.
5. Open **[this link](https://github.com/khanhas/MagickMeter/releases)** and dowload the latest release of the **MagickMeter** skin. The `magickmeter_0.7.3.rmskin` Rainmeter skin file will be used to install for this guide. 
6. Leave the installation settings at their defaults and click Install.

And that is how you setup **ImageMagick**. You can now proceed to configure the Clock Presets.

* **Note:** An alternate approach for **Step 5** and **Step 6** is:
  - Download the [plugin DLLs](https://github.com/khanhas/MagickMeter/releases)
  - Copy the version that corresponds to your system from the zip file (x86 or x64)
  - Open Run(`Win + R`), type `%appdata%\Rainmeter\Plugins\` and press **OK**.
  - Manually paste DLL you copied in the second step.
  - Finally, restart Rainmeter and your plugin will be activated.

#### Choosing Presets:
Follow the steps outlined below to setup custom video backgrounds:

1. Open Core and head over to the **Modules** section.
2. Select **ModularClocks** from the list and proceed to the **Appearance** tab.
3. Under **Clock Style** choose a preset that tickles your fancy.
4. The clock style will be changed if you refresh **ModularClocks** by deactivating and activating the toggle on the bottom left.

* **Note:** The **Render** and **Appearance** tabs allow you to further customize each preset as required.
